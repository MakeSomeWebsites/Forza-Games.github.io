		<p> In The Crew 2, there are multiple racing disciplines, in which players try to become successful.
			The game is based in a free roam, scaled down United States.
			The game includes cars, airplanes, motorcycles, and boats, all of which have different physics, leading to different gameplay.
			The Crew 2 was developed by Ivory Tower, published by Ubisoft, and released on June 29, 2018 for use on Microsoft Windows, PS4, and Xbox One as a sequel to The Crew, which was released in 2014.
			Similar to The Crew, The Crew 2 has a huge emphasis on multiplayer.
