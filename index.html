		Forza Motorsport 2 was created by Turn 10 Studios.
		It was also published by Microsoft and was released on May 24, 2007 for the Xbox 360.
		Similar to Forza Motorsport, players would compete on real world and fictional race courses using 349 licensed cars (including DLCs).
		These cars are divided into six production classes and four race classes, which can limit the races the cars are eligible for.
		Also, similar to Forza Motorsport, players could play in single-player, or play in an 8-player multiplayer using Xbox Live.
		The game also had 2-player split-screen and 8-player System Link compatibility.
		Most cars in the game can be visually customized with aerodynamic parts as well as graphics that can be created using the livery editor.
		The damage and physics have been improved from the previous game, allowing multiple settigs: "simulation", "limited", and "cosmetic".
		The damage ratings for each part can be seen on the HUD (heads up display).
		The game runs in 720p resolution (HD) at 60fps with replays that run at 30fps.
		The game was released in three editions: the regular edition, the <em>Limited Collector's Edition</em>, and the platinum hits edition.

		Forza Motorsport 3 was also created by Turn 10 Studios.
		It was published by Microsoft Studios and was released on October 22, 2009 for the Xbox 360.
		It won many awards such as the VGX Award for Best Driving Game, and the Golden Joystick Award for Racing Game of the Year.
		The game includes more than 400 customizable cars (more than 500 cars in the Ultimate Collection version) from 50 manufacturers.
		These cars vary from production to race cars.
		It also has more than 100 race track variations and the ability to race up to eight cars at a time.
		The game had new drag racing and drifting.
		It also had SUVs (mostly Crossovers).
		Also new was the addition of stock cars.
		The game also provides the ability to paint and upgrade all of the cars.
		In Forza Motorsport 2, only production and tuner cars could be painted or upgraded.
		The game comes on two discs, but only uses one for gameplay.
		The second disc is the "installation disc," which contains extra vehicle and track content.
		Also, Xbox Live users are able to buy and sell cars in the "auction house."
		Players are also able to buy and sell their personalized paint jobs for cars.
		During an interview at E3 2009, the game director revealed that the updated physics engine would include tire deformation, and the ability to flip the car over.
		The game director also included that there is a "pressure" system in which the AI would make mistakes when under pressure (depending on how the difficulty is set).
		The interview also confirmed that the game would run at 60 frames per second.
		Unlike its predecessors, Forza Motorsport 3 doesn't support System Link.
		Three editions of the game were released: Standard Edition, Limited Edition, and later, an Ultimate Collection Edition.
